# Linux_Qt_Project

This is a project provided and shared by Mr. Reyan Valdes of ITGTEC

It comes with source code  & binary build for Ubuntu 18 or higher.

a) Source code  & building (executable) C++11 Qt. The project folder is labeled DI-2108P because was used for testing but actually the two classes developed DATAQ_BASE, DATAQ_USB are supporting more models.

b) additional python module attached here for parsing the DATAQ recording file generated by the example4.

In this version we have supported not only 2108P, but 4 DATAQ models: DI-2108, DI-2108P, DI-4108, DI-4208, the other models are pending in TODO list, to complete later on in a near future, if you are interesting. However all testing was done using DI-2108P, so I would recommend testing the same examples provided but only change the model name.  Included are 4 examples, the last one is the cyclic recording, very handy. One can use it as separated service that is running and generate a simple text file, while other process like python module can read from recorded file and feed into a third party software the data.
